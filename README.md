1. Overview

</div>
</div>
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
This assignment will familiarize you with the Python programming language and the Thonny Python IDE editor, which you will use throughout the semester. Python is an easy-to-learn but powerful programming language and is the fastest growing programming language for embedded systems. In this course, you will use MicroPython to program the ESP32 board. MicroPython is a lean and efficient implementation of the Python3 programming language. Before working with MicroPython on your board, you should acquaint yourself with Python.

2. Getting started with Python and MicroPython

The following sections describe various software installation procedures.

2.1. Installing Thonny IDE on your own PC

Thonny is a Python IDE meant for learning programming. You can find more details about this IDE on https://thonny.org and https://github.com/thonny/thonny/wiki. Installation instructions for Windows, Linux, and Mac OS are provided on the following webpage: https://randomnerdtutorials.com/getting-started-thonny-micropython-python-ide-esp32- esp8266/. You might get a Windows Smart Screen Filter warning when trying to install Thonny IDE on Windows, you can safely ignore it and go ahead with the installation. More details can be found at https://github.com/thonny/thonny/wiki/Windows. Install the latest version, 3.3.13.

. However, if you want to use a separate Python installation, you can find Python installation instructions at https://realpython.com/installing-python/.

2.2. Install USB Driver on your own PC (Windows and Mac only)

Download and install the CP210x USB to UART Bridge VCP Drivers so that your machine identifies when you connect ESP32 board to your PC. You can download the files here: https://www.silabs.com/products/development-tools/software/usb-to-uart-bridge-vcp-drivers.

</div>
</div>
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
By default, Thonny comes with Python 3.7 built in, so, separate installation of Python is not

<div class="column">
necessary

</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="page" title="Page 2">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
Linux machines usually do not need this driver, however, if your Linux machine is unable to detect the board, you might want to install Linux version of this driver.

2.3. Flashing MicroPython on ESP32 (using Thonny)

The latest version of Thonny (3.3.13) comes preinstalled with the package ‚Äòesptool‚Äô, which is a Python-based, open source, platform independent, utility to communicate with the ROM bootloader in ESP32. Esptool can be used to load MicroPython on your ESP32 board.

2.3.1. Acquiring MicroPython Firmware

Download latest ESP32 firmware from http://micropython.org/download. As of today, the latest available firmware is ‚Äòesp32-20210902-v1.17.bin‚Äô (you can click this link directly to download the firmware).

2.3.2. Thonny Setup and Flashing

<ul>
<li>Plug in your ESP32 board to your computer using a microUSB cable, launch Thonny and navigate to ‚ÄúRun &gt; Select Interpreter‚Äù.</li>
<li>Under the ‚ÄúWhich interpreter or device should Thonny use for running your code?‚Äù label, select ‚ÄúMicroPython (ESP32)‚Äù.</li>
<li>Select the COM port to which your ESP32 is connected under ‚ÄúPort‚Äù (see Figure 1).
Figure 1. Set the interpreter and port
</li>
<li>After setting the interpreter and the port, click on the button: ‚ÄúOpen the dialog for installing or upgrading MicroPython on your device‚Äù. Select your device‚Äôs port again and browse for the MicroPython firmware that you downloaded earlier for the ‚ÄúFirmware‚Äù field. If you are flashing MicroPython on your board for the first time, then make sure that ‚ÄúErase flash before installing‚Äù is checked, then click ‚ÄúInstall‚Äù, as shown in Figure 2.</li>
</ul>

2.4. Alternative Method to flash MicroPython 2.4.1. Installing esptool on your PC

You can read further details on esptool here: https://github.com/espressif/esptool. You can install esptool using any one of the following methods:

1. Using python package installer, pip:

&gt;&gt; pip3 install esptool

2. Using Thonny‚Äôs package manager:

To access the package manager, open Thonny and go to the menu bar and select ‚ÄúTools &gt; Manage Packages‚Äù. This should pop open a new window with a search field. Type ‚Äòesptool‚Äô into that field and click the ‚ÄúFind package from PyPI‚Äù button. Go ahead and click ‚ÄúInstall‚Äù to install this package. You will see a small window pop up showing the system‚Äôs logs while it installs the package. After the installation is finished, the plug-ins window can be closed. Then close and reopen Thonny. Now, you are ready to use esptool.

NOTE: You can use this method in future labs to install any additional packages.

2.4.2. Flashing MicroPython on ESP32 Board

Program your board using the esptool.py program. If you are putting MicroPython on your board (identified as /dev/ttyUSBx*, x=0/1/2) for the first time, then erase the entire flash using:

&gt;&gt; esptool.py ‚Äìchip esp32 ‚Äìport /dev/ttyUSB0 erase_flash

Then program the firmware starting at address 0x1000 using:

&gt;&gt; esptool.py ‚Äìchip esp32 ‚Äìport /dev/ttyUSB0 ‚Äìbaud 460800 write_flash -z 0x1000 &lt;path to micropython .bin&gt; 3. Python programming exercises

You DO NOT need to use ESP32 for this part. You can use the default python interpreter.

3.1. Character Input (Upload as program1.py)

4. Digital input/output using GPIOs

This section explains how to get started with the Adafruit HUZZAH32 ‚Äì ESP32 Feather board and how to program the board using MicroPython and Thonny IDE. The goal of this experiment is to walk you through the embedded software development flow for the ESP32, where you will learn how to use microcontroller I/O, the inputs and outputs, to sense and actuate devices in the world outside the board.

The assignment is subdivided into two sections. In the first section, you will learn to implement a simple LED blink program that will give you a high-level idea of how you can accomplish the remaining labs. In the second section, you will interface two LEDs (Red and Green) and 2 Push Button Switches with the board and implement a simple pattern function using them.

The ESP32-WROOM-32 module on the Feather Board has 38 pins, many of which are GPIO (general-purpose input/output) pins. However, the feather board has only 28 pins and has its own ad-hoc pin numbering (marked e.g. A0, A1‚Ä¶) with many peripheral pins (like TX, RX, SCL, SDA‚Ä¶) indicated on the board itself. You need to explore the ESP32-WROOM-32 datasheet and Feather board manuals and Schematics to figure out the mapping between physical chip pins and board logical pins, and interface LEDs and Switches with the board pins.

4.1. Programming ESP32 using Thonny IDE

Before proceeding further, you should have completed installing any necessary software (explained in Section 2) and flashed MicroPython on the ESP32 board. The implementation procedure explained in this section demonstrates a typical procedure to run any program on the board.

4.2. Connect the Board to PC

Connect the board to your PC using the Micro USB cable (just plug into the jack) and the Feather will regulate the 5V USB down to 3.3V which will power the board. In addition, you can also connect the Lithium ion polymer (Lipo/Lipoly) battery to the JST jack (if you have ordered it), which will get continuously charged by the USB Power (OPTIONAL).

4.3. Testing Thonny IDE Installation

Connect the board to your PC and open Thonny IDE. To test the installation, you need to tell Thonny that you want to run MicroPython Interpreter and select

the board you are using.

<ol>
<li>Go to Tools &gt; Options and select the Interpreter tab. Select MicroPython (ESP32).</li>
<li>Select the device serial port: Silicon Labs CP210x USB to UART Bridge (COMPort)
Figure 7. Thonny Interpreter and Port selection
</li>
</ol>
Thonny IDE should now be connected to your board. The board will start and run the files ‚Äòboot.py‚Äô and ‚Äòmain.py‚Äô (if any) automatically and provide you a MicroPython REPL shell. A read‚Äìeval‚Äìprint-loop (REPL), also termed interactive top-level or language shell, is a simple, interactive computer programming environment that takes single user inputs (i.e., single expressions), evaluates (executes) them, and returns the result to the user, shown in Figure 8.

4.4. Using the REPL

Once you have a prompt, you can start experimenting! Anything you type at the prompt will be executed after you press the Enter key. MicroPython will run the code on the board that you enter and print the result (if there is one). If there is an error with the text that you enter, then an error message is printed. You can find more information on REPL at http://docs.micropython.org/en/latest/esp8266/tutorial/repl.html (MicroPython execution is similar in ESP8266 and ESP32).

Figure 9. Experimenting with REPL

Type the command help() in the Shell and see if it responds back. If it responded back, everything is working fine.

Figure 10. Testing the REPL

4.5. FirstProgramontheESP32

In the EDITOR of the Thonny IDE, write your first ‚ÄòHello World‚Äô program and save it on the board as main.py. The IDE asks for location to save the file, Select MicroPython device to save the file on the flash memory on the board, as shown in Figure 11. Pressing Ctrl+D or selecting Run &gt; Send EOF/Soft Reboot in Thonny will perform a soft reboot of the board and as mentioned earlier, it will run main.py and you will see the output on the MicroPython shell. You can also run the program main.py from the shell by calling the following command, which will run the code inside main.py and give you output on the shell, both of which are shown in

4.6. Theinternalfilesystem

Since ESP32 Feather has 4MB flash memory, a default filesystem will be generated upon first boot, which uses the FAT format and is stored in the flash after the MicroPython firmware. You can open any file already stored inside the board using Thonny IDE, modify it and save it back on the board. More details on working with the internal filesystem are available at this webpage: http://docs.micropython.org/en/latest/esp8266/tutorial/filesystem.html.

5. ESP32 Programming Exercises 5.1. SimpleBlinkProgram(main.py)

The example source code below blinks the Red LED on the ESP32 Feather board 5 times with the interval of roughly 0.5 seconds. Use this source code and save as main.py file on your board and perform a soft reboot. Use the Feather board schematics to figure out the pin X connected to the red LED on the board.

5.2. LEDPatternDisplayusingSwitches(pattern.py)

Now that you have gone through the warm-up program above, you can finally get to the actual problem statement for Lab 1. Implement a simple pattern function by interfacing two push button switches and two external LEDs (red and green) with the ESP32 Feather board that performs the operation given in Table 1. The switches are considered to be ON when they are pushed down and OFF when they are released.

<div class="layoutArea">

</div>
<div class="column">

</div>
</div>
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
In addition, you must determine the number of times Switch1 and Switch2 are pressed from the start of the program. If any one of the switches is pressed 10 times, the pattern in Table 1 should be stopped and the two LEDs should start blinking alternatively. This should continue until your program detects a switch press on the other switch (i.e., NOT the switch, which was pressed 10 times, pressing it again should not have any effect).

Sample Program Flow:

‚Ä¢ The user starts testing the pattern function; the program starts turning the LEDs ON and

OFF depending upon switch presses.

</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="page" title="Page 11">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
‚Ä¢ Let us assume that throughout the testing, Switch1 is pressed 9 times and Switch2 is pressed 5 times. On the next Switch1 press (the 10th press), the LEDs start blinking alternatively. The user presses Switch2, both LEDs turn OFF and the program displays a message on the MicroPython shell ‚ÄòYou have successfully implemented LAB1 DEMO!!!‚Äô and exits to the shell.
